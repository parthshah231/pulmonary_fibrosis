# Project Goal
- To develop a prediction model to determine the severity of decline in lung function for pateints with fibrotic lung disease. The aim is to provide patients and clinicians with a better understanding of the disease progression and prognosis.

## First look
![CT Scan](https://https://github.com/parthshah231/pulmonary_fibrosis/blob/master/README/test3.gif)

- The gif above showcases a CT scan, captured while the patient is either breathing in or holding their breath.
- The patient is lying on their back (in a supine position). Each image represents a different cross-section (axial) of the thorax (the area between the neck and belly)

## Bayesian Modeling

What is Bayesian Modeling?
- Bayesian modeling is a statistical approach that combines our previous knowledge and current data to make educated predictions. It allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence, providing a way to handle uncertainty by offering a range of possible outcomes instead of one fixed answer. Essentially, it's like updating our best guess using both what we knew before and what we've just learned.
